AJAX - Was an assignment designed to teach me AJAX however in the code however there was an error for me that wasn't apart of my code so it doesn't work

Async - Was an assignment to teach me the async syntax and that's the only thing it does

Calculator - is an empty file because I never got around to it

jQuery - seems to have been something I missed so it also does nothing

One-page Website - is a copy of the website that I currently have live I made a copy here so I can show the files here in the current module and so I can test edits without messing up the real website

Pizza_Project - is a simple website that was made to show me different types of features in html/css/JS

project -> project 10 - are all really simple projects designed to teach me different features 

portfolio example - Is not my code it's the template I took inspiration from in the one-page website assignment

TicTacToe - Is also not my code as the entire module told me to copy the code

Todo App - is supposed to be a simple list that you can add and remove objects from but I couldn't get the remove function to work so I left it to work on the webpage assignment
